# Understanding Runtime in LangChain

This repository explores the concept of **Runtime** in LangChain/LangGraph, a powerful feature that makes multi-agent systems and context engineering significantly easier to implement and manage.

## What is Runtime?

In LangChain, **Runtime** is the elegant solution to the messy problem of context management. Think of Runtime as your agent's memory, configuration, and toolbox all rolled into one object that travels with every request.

**Note**: Runtime is a key concept that makes LangChain powerful for production applications. By mastering Runtime, you can build sophisticated multi-agent systems with clean, maintainable code, I know it's a very small concept but very powerful.
